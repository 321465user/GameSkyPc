<br><br><h3><b><p>In 2004, Michael Townley, Trevor Philips, and Brad Snider were bank robbers living in Ludendorff, in the state of North Yankton (based in North Dakota ). Michael, wanting to escape from that life then, plans a fake heist alongside corrupt federal agent Dave Norton (Dave had to kill Trevor and arrest Brad while Michael faked his death). But everything goes wrong because Dave instead of shooting Trevor, shoots Brad and Trevor escapes. Michael is presumed dead and is placed under witness protection by the corrupt FIB agent Dave Norton, a close friend of the same, thus transferring him with his family to Los Santos (San Andreas) with a new identity: “Michael De Santa”.<br>

Nine years later (2013), Franklin Clinton, who works as a vehicle repossessor at a car dealership, along with his friend Lamar Davis, is asked to recover a vehicle belonging to Michael’s son Jimmy, who is behind in the payment of its acquisition. Concerning that his son is about to become a victim of credit fraud , Michael hides in the vehicle and confronts Franklin. When he drives on the way to the dealership, he forces him to crash the car against the shop window. Clinton is fired, but he and De Santa become friends.<br>

Later, when Michael discovers his wife Amanda in bed with his tennis coach Kyle Chavis, he and Franklin chase him to a mansion, which Michael angrily destroys. Unfortunately for him, the property belongs to Natalia Zverovna, the lover of Mexican drug lord Martín Madrazo, a woman who happened to be a student of the aforementioned trainer. Iracundo, Madrazo locates De Santa and demands compensation from him. They agree to pay their debt through the money obtained from a robbery at a branch of the Vangelico jewelry chain. Trevor Philips, the other survivor of the Ludendorff robbery, finds out about the robbery by watching television. At that moment he realizes that the author could not be other than Townley himself, recognizing him from a phrase he said on the day of the initial robbery.<br>

Meanwhile, the personal lives of the protagonists begin to spiral out of control. Trevor’s unexpected reappearance triggers reckless and erratic behavior in Michael Townley, prompting his family to leave home. Likewise, Michael’s attempts to do something in life lead him to Devin Weston, a billionaire venture capitalist and corporate raider, who develops a grudge against him. Franklin is disturbed by the way Lamar falls under the influence of Harold “Stretch” Joseph, a gangsterwho defected to the Families gang during his time in prison, turning to the enemy (the Ballas) and repeatedly trying to kill Lamar to prove himself to his new allies. For his part, Trevor makes his efforts to consolidate his power and control over the methamphetamine market in Blaine County, after having rebelled against the motorcycle gang The Lost, the Mexican Varrios Los Aztecas, the Salvadorans La Marabunta Grande, traffickers of local methamphetamine, mercenaries hired by the government and against a triad led by Wei Cheng, one of the most important figures in the Chinese underworld.</h3></b></p>
